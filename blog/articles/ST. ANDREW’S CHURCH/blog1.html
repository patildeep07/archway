            <p>This is the story of one of the most timeless and oldest churches in Mumbai, whose walls have stood strong for 400 years and counting. The structure has passed the test of time and has seen 50 more winters and summers than the Taj Mahal in Agra.</p>
            <p>It was constructed in 1575 when Mumbai’s Salcette island (currently the Mumbai City district, suburban district, Mira Bhayander and a portion of thane) came under the rule of the Portuguese Jesuits. Back then, the area was covered with farmlands and had a fresh coastal aura. Villages were built and the natives called this beloved city as Bom Bahia. After the Portuguese took over in the early 1530s, major changes were not executed until the arrival of Brother Manoel Gomes – the apostle of Salcette. Parts of some settlements were burnt down, pork and sausages became staple breakfast items and Portuguese architecture was widely seen. He baptized more than 2000 residents by 1580 and the numbers continued to multiply till 1603.</p>
            <p>Practically, the whole of Bandra was Catholic by then. The St. Anne’s Church was the oldest until it was converted into a slaughterhouse and now is the BEST depot near Bandra station. It was blown up by the English in 1739, which left St. Andrew’s as the only existing church and served the city’s spiritual needs. These historical church bells have chimed for over 450 years now. It is observed that the first sun rays fall directly upon the church’s holy cross on the equinox days of March 21 and September 22.</p>
            <p>Natural disasters, political turmoil, or invasions, nothing destroyed the church’s beauty and it is still one of the most historically dense structures in Mumbai. To celebrate the existence of this holy church, several events are conducted every year around Christmas where people from in and around Mumbai come together. One such occasion is the feast of St. Cecilia. A bunch of musicians and their families gather to thank god for the gift of music he has given them.</p>
            <p>The church has seen its share of thick and thin, but what makes it’s story different is how it stood firm against all odds. After all, it’s Mumbai – the city where life always goes on.</p>
